# Syncing repo for dotfiles of Aaron Holbrook, feel free to use for inspiration!

I put the following command into a Text Expander snippet:

`wget -q -O - "$@" https://raw.github.com/AaronHolbrook/dotfiles/master/bash_profile >> ~/.bash_profile`

And then I can easily pull in new changes to whatever machine I'm running on.
